<p>I’m a master student in Computer Sciences, studying at EPFL. I have a strong interest in computer graphics and more recently in physically-based rendering and raytracing in general.<br>
I also have some notions of biology and physics, following a minor in biocomputing, and am quite interested in all methods regarding light-organism interactions.</p>

<p><strong>Spring 2016:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Introduction to visual Computing</strong><br>

<em>Project in collaboration with Marc Jolles and Thomas Garcia.<br>
The goal was to design a game using augmented reality: the user holds a board which can be tilted, so as to move a virtual ball onto the board. The goal is to hit as many objects as possible on the board with the ball to accumulate points!<br>
This project was the occasion to study a simple game-building, study intersections, modelization of simple objects and their bounding boxes from a mathematical perspective, as well as create a simple physical engine, along with some gamification notions, such as scores, visualization and human perception for the purpose of tangible rewards in the context of a game.</em></p>

<p><strong>Introduction to Computer Graphics</strong><br>
[ Image ]<br>
<em>Project in collaboration with Marc Jolles and Jonathan Scanzi.<br>
The purpose of this project was to construct a 3D scene in realtime, under specific scenery constraints, such as presence of water, procedural terrain (generated using a variant of Perlin noise), skybox…<br>
The scene was built in OpenGL and C++, around a rasterization pipeline. Added features were most notably fast god-rays, implemented using an approach suggested in GPU Gems 3, which is basically a ray-tracing approach using objects as occluders for different sources of light. To speed up computations, only object contours are considered to create the god-rays, which provide a significant speed-up but also discards a lot of potential complexity in the light behaviour. L-systems were also studied, for the purpose of building procedural vegetation.</em></p>

<p><strong>Super-resolution enhancement</strong><br>
[ Image ]<br>
<em>Project in collaboration with Aimee Montero and Arsalan Syed in the context of the Computational photography course.<br>
The purpose of this project was to compare two approaches to deep learning based super resolution, one based on wavelet 		     transforms and the other on the spatial domain.  Super-resolution has many applications, in biomedical fields, but also simply to improve resolution of images in and on itself. It 		     interestingly relies on aliasing to recover partial information and obtain better resolution.</em></p>
